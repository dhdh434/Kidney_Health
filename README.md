# Kidney Health Web Application
About 2.5 years ago, I was the main developer on a team of four that built a web application to track health data and nutrient intake for patients with diabetes.
The site was developed using Python, Django, and a SQLite database. It connected to a nutrition API that allowed patients to
log their food intake and receive detailed nutrient information. The application also included user authentication and interactive graphs to visualize health trends.
